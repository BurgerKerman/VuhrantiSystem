        //Descriptions
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0001 = A FΦ-Type main sequence star that serves as the system's lightsource. Named after the creation goddess Albeynda's son, the ancient Kerbal god of light. Vuhranti is an ultra rare Electronium Star, which extends its life to about 417 billion Verlodian years, of which currently about 2.37 billion have passed. Official designation in the Kerbal Local Star System Catalogue: KLSSC-1
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0002 = Homeworld of our Kerbalkind, and one of few really habitable places in the Vuhranti system. Its name is inspired from the ancient creator god of Kerbalkind and grandson of Albeynda, Véhlond.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0003 = Named after the first emperor of Kerbalkind. It's mass is greater than that of all other planets and moons combined, making it the perfect world to slingshot probes out of the system, unless you want to visit its vast system of moons.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0004 = It's named after Véhlond's little sister, Yeleène. Not only is Yelern pretty close to Verlod, its also about two thirds the radius of its parent planet. Due to the barycenter of those two worlds being located outside their surfaces and Yelern's size, some astronomers say that Verlod and Yelern should be considered a double planet.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0005 = Elota got its name from Reatu's wife. It's the second largest of Reatu's "Big Five" moons, and has a thin atmosphere. There's also a lot of ice there, so maybe we should colonize it?
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0006 = Fittingly named after the goddess of the seas, Lahyn ist the largest terrestrial world in the Vuhranti System - nearly thrice the diameter of Verlod. It has more water than both Verlod and Reatu's moon Elota combined.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0007 = Osourtik is barely large enough to be classified as a planet, which is why it's now named after the god of dwarves. Known during antiquity as Deesmerba, the planet's high eccentricity and inclination compared to the other inner planets baffles many scientists. 
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0008 = A little fun fact: The discoverer of this world thought it was an orange for 20 whole years until he was told that "Oranges don't grow in space". That's why Sinoge is named after the God of Fruits.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0009 = Located in a trojan orbit of Yelern. It's most likely a fragment of Yelern from an ancient impact event. Named after the War God Yaru, who cut off Yeleène's left pinky finger in retalitation of Véhlond forbidding war.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0010 = Discovered two days before its parent planet and named after Nejal's signature weapon. Trezag's retrograde orbit suggests that it once was a dwarf planet, being captured by its parent planet later on.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0011 = Once an active volcanic moon and named after Reatu's most trusted blacksmith, Fuandro is the fourth largest of the "Big Five" moons orbiting the gas giant. Its massive equatorial bulge rises dozens of kilometers above the rest of the dusty surface.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0012 = The third largest of Reatu's "Big Five" moons, named after the Emperor's lead cartographer. Most of the moon's northern hemisphere is covered in ice due to internal activity that sometimes also causes eruptions, which supply Reatu's outer ring with dust and ice. 
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0013 = The innermost and smallest of the "Big Five", Mavurya got its name from the aunt of Reatu, Archpriestess Mavurya. Despite being the smallest of Reatu's "Big Five", it has the second highest gravity of all Reatuni moons. This is mainly due to a higher concentration of metals, which are partially exposed to the surface at the major cratera rims, mixed into blue-ish soil.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0014 = The largest of Reatu's "Big Five", as well as the largest moon in the Vuhranti System, named after Reatu's younger evil twin brother. The only moon to have liquid Electronium seas, an atmosphere, a ring system and a moon of its own combined. Scientists believe that Arxos formed inwards of Ishret's orbit and was flung into Reatu's orbit in the early times of the Vuhranti System.
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0015 = Named after Arxos' pet snake, this rock was initially mistaken for a flying saucer. Rikad is the only known moon of a moon - an object known as a "submoon".
        #LOC_VuhrantiSystem_celDesc_0016 = A nearby faint and small red dwarf star surrounded by a disk of dusk. It also houses a huge concentration of gravitational anomalies.
